## Showcase
### ‚öõÔ∏è Regular Magnetic Scroll
As you scroll, when the `ScrollView`'s velocity is lesser than `MagneticScrollView`'s velocity, magnetic scroll automatically sticks to the predicted end location.

### ‚ú® Manually changing the blocks

## Usage
```swift 
import SwiftUI
import MagneticScroll

struct ContentView: View {
  // If you were to set activeBlock to "second" or "first" manually, MagneticScroll would automatically scroll to the block with that id.
  @State private var activeBlock = "first"
  var body: some View {
    MagneticScrollView(activeBlock: $activeBlock) { organizer in
      Block(id: "first", height: 400, inActiveHeight: 300) { // All of these fields are optional, except the ID, but magnetic scroll works x5 better with constant heights.
        Text("Hello World")
      }
      Block(id: "second", height: 400, inActiveHeight: 300) {
        Text("Hello World")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Methods

Here are the methods available for configuring the behavior of `MagneticScrollView`:

### üñ±Ô∏è changesActiveBlockOnTapGesture(_ value: Bool)
Sets whether the active block should be changed on a tap gesture.
### üèÅ velocityThreshold(_ threshold: Double)
Sets the velocity threshold for `MagneticScrollView` to react to scroll view velocity.
### üì≥ triggersHapticFeedbackOnBlockChange(_ bool: Bool)
Sets whether haptic feedback should be triggered when the active block changes.
### üì≥ triggersHapticFeedbackOnActiveBlockChange(_ bool: Bool)
Sets whether haptic feedback should be triggered when the active block changes.
### üìã formStyle(_ bool:)
Sets whether the form style should be enabled or not.
### ‚è≥ scrollAnimationDuration(_ duration: Double)
Sets the scroll animation duration when changing the active block.
### ‚åõ setTimeout(_ duration: Double)
Sets the timeout duration needed to change a block to another.

## Organizer
`MagneticScrollView` gives an organizer to control the behavior of itself. Organizer contains a `ScrollViewProxy` so if you want to control the `ScrollView` itself, you can use that.
### ü™ê activate(with: Block.ID)
Activates a block with given ID. But doesn't scroll to it
### üëáüèª scrollTo(id: Block.ID, anchor: UnitPoint)
Scrolls and activates a block with given id and anchor
### üëÜüèª scrollToCurrentOffset()
Scrolls to the nearest block with the current offset of the `MagneticScrollView`.
